add sdl2.dll to the main directory, and sdl2.lib to the dll directory,
then update the ged to point to the new locations. this is necessary
because ged files only store absolute paths.

you can get the sdl2 files here:

https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

look for devel libs for visual c++ x86.
