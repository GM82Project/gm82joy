# gm82joy
This is a replacement joystick system for Game Maker 8.1. Adding the extension
completely replaces the builtin joystick functions with SDL2, which supports a
lot more types of controllers. We also provide some new convenience functions
that help you use joysticks in your games.

### a note about compatibility
This extension requires [gm82core](https://github.com/omicronrex/gm82core), so install that as well.
