# gm82joy
This is a replacement joystick system for Game Maker 8.2. Adding the extension
completely replaces the builtin joystick functions with SDL2 wrappers, which
support a lot more types of controllers. We also provide some new convenience
functions that help you use joysticks in your games.

### a note about compatibility
This extension is designed for the Game Maker 8.2 extension suite.
